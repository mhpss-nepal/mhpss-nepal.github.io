/* =====================================================================
   Attribution band — MHPSS Nepal
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   TO TURN THE EMBLEMS ON: put the official files in assets/ and set the
   two paths below. Nothing else needs changing — every page that loads
   this file picks them up.

       who:  "assets/logo-who-nepal.png"
       mohp: "assets/logo-mohp-edcd.png"

   Leave them null and the band shows a written credit instead, which is
   what it does now.

   USE ONLY FILES SUPPLIED BY THE ORGANISATIONS THEMSELVES.
   WHO Nepal's public notice on unauthorised use of the WHO logo states
   that it "may only be used with the express written permission of the
   WHO", that its use "implies endorsement by the WHO", and that use is
   restricted to bodies with official collaborating status, in
   conjunction with work undertaken with WHO. A logo taken from a web
   search is the wrong file at the wrong resolution without that
   permission, and it lands on the person who published the page.

   The paths are a flag rather than an <img> that fails quietly on
   purpose: a missing file would 404 on every page load and fill the
   console with errors that hide real ones.
