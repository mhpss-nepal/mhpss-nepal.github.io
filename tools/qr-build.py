"""
MHPSS Nepal -- regenerate the pre-computed QR matrices
======================================================
Run this whenever the site address changes. It rewrites assets/qr.js with
matrices that actually encode the new address, then verifies every one of them
by decoding it back -- because the whole failure mode here is a QR that LOOKS
right and points somewhere dead.

Usage:  qr-build.py https://new-address.example        [--write]
Without --write it is a dry run and prints what would change.

The paths are declared here, once. Add a form to this list and it gets a QR.
