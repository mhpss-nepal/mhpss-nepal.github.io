"""
MHPSS Nepal -- text setting, static gate.

Runs anywhere, including the Mac, because it parses the files rather than a
browser. tools/justify-sweep.py is the DOM sweep and needs Playwright; this
is what stands in the deploy path.

Four assertions, each of them a mistake that has actually been made:
  1. the rule is declared, with justify AND hyphens:none
  2. no `hyphens: auto` is declared ANYWHERE -- it is the textbook companion
     to justified text and it is refused on these pages
  3. no rule bundles `th` with `td` and sets text-align on the pair. At
     (0,1,1) such a rule silently beats a bare `td` justification; two of
     them were doing exactly that before this gate existed
  4. .mono breaks with `break-word`, never `anywhere`
