"""
MHPSS Nepal -- the offline-completeness check
=============================================
The field form is meant to work with no signal. That only holds if every
file the form NEEDS is in the service worker's precache list. The fetch
handler is cache-first with a network fallback, so a missing file is
invisible online -- it is fetched, cached, and everything looks fine. The
failure only appears on a phone that has no signal and has never happened
to load that file: the request returns a 504 with an empty body.

That became dangerous the moment the pages were keyed up for Nepali. The
HTML now carries keys, not sentences, so assets/i18n.js and
assets/i18n-strings.js are not decoration -- without them a form renders
with no words on it at all. The same will be true of every page keyed up
from here.

So this walks the precached HTML pages, resolves every script and
stylesheet they reference, and fails if any of them is not itself
precached. It runs inside the deploy guard.

Exit 0 complete / 1 a page needs a file that is not precached / 2 cannot read.
