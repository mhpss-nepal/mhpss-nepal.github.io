"""
MHPSS Nepal -- the QR integrity check
=====================================
The QR codes in assets/qr.js are PRE-COMPUTED BIT MATRICES, on purpose: no CDN
library, so they render on a phone with no signal. The consequence is easy to
miss and expensive.

    The address is baked into the matrix. The "url" field beside it is only a
    label. Editing that label changes NOTHING about where the QR points.

So if the site address ever moves -- a renamed repo, a custom domain, a new
path -- every matrix has to be REGENERATED (tools/qr-build.py). A QR printed on
a wall at a holding centre cannot be corrected later, and the failure is
silent: a field worker points a camera and lands on a dead page.

This decodes every matrix and asserts two things:
  1. it decodes to exactly the url label sitting next to it
  2. that url begins with the site's declared base

Exit 0 all consistent / 1 a QR points somewhere it should not / 2 cannot run.

Usage: qr-check.py [base-url]        default base: tools/site.conf
