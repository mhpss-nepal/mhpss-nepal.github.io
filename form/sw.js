/* =====================================================================
   MHPSS Nepal — field forms service worker
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lives at /form/sw.js so its scope is /form/ — GitHub Pages will not
   let us set a Service-Worker-Allowed header, so the file's own location
   is what defines the scope.

   Strategy, chosen deliberately:
     - HTML pages   : network first, cache as fallback. A worker with
                      signal always gets the current questions; a worker
                      without signal still gets the form.
     - CSS/JS/icons : cache first, revalidated in the background, so the
                      form opens instantly and quietly updates.
   Bump CACHE when anything in PRECACHE changes, or phones keep the old copy.
   ===================================================================== */
/* BUMP THIS on every change to any precached file.
   A service worker serves the cached copy until the cache name changes, so
   a phone that has already opened the form keeps running the OLD code --
   old validation, and (16 Sep 2026) a version of store.js that did not sync
   to the register at all. The fix was deployed and had no effect on any
   device until this line changed. */

     exactly the no-signal setting the form exists for. The audit that
     found this is in tools/sw-precache-check.py, and it runs in the

     Ministry instrument. mark.js and icons.js draw inline SVG, so they are
     the reason the form has a logo and icons AT ALL with no signal -- an
     image file or an icon font would simply fail there.
     The webfont is deliberately NOT here: it is cross-origin, so the
     cached response would be opaque and unusable. design.css declares
     Georgia and the system sans as fallbacks, so offline the form is set
     in those. Typography degrades; legibility does not. */
